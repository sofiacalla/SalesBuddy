# Sales Buddy - The Sales CRM That Actually Helps You Sell

## 🌟 Why We Created Sales Buddy

We built Sales Buddy because we believe CRM software has become too complicated. Instead of helping salespeople close deals, most CRMs turn into administrative burdens—endless forms, confusing menus, and cluttered screens that distract from the actual job of selling.

**Our Mission:** To simplify the CRM process for all sellers. We strip away the noise and focus purely on:
1.  **Health:** Is the pipeline real?
2.  **Focus:** What do I need to do *today*?
3.  **Truth:** Can we trust our forecast?

## 🚀 Key Features & Functionality

### 1. Executive Dashboard (The "Truth" Center)
*Designed for Sales Managers and Leaders.*

Most dashboards are just pretty charts. Ours is a diagnostic tool for business health.
*   **Forecast Reliability (MAPE):** We don't just show you the number; we tell you how accurate your team's predictions have been historically. This stops the "guessing game" at the end of the quarter.
*   **Pipeline Health Score:** A single metric that tells you if your pipeline is clean or full of "zombie deals."
*   **AI Risk Detection:**
    *   **Stale Deals:** Automatically flags opportunities that haven't had activity in 7+ days.
    *   **Concentration Risk:** Warns you if too much of your revenue depends on a single deal.
    *   **Sandbagging:** Identifies deals that are likely to close but aren't committed yet.
*   **Coaching Opportunities:** Instead of yelling at reps to "update Salesforce," managers can see exactly *who* needs help and *where*.

### 2. My Week (The Rep's Copilot)
*Designed for Account Executives and SDRs.*

Sales reps shouldn't have to hunt for work. "My Week" tells them exactly what to do.
*   **Smart Action Items:** The system automatically generates a to-do list based on deal activity.
    *   "Update Next Steps for [Company X]"
    *   "Log activity for [Company Y]"
*   **Focus Mode:** A distraction-free interface that lets reps click through their updates one by one, like a playlist. No more opening 50 tabs.
*   **Urgency Ranking:** Deals are sorted by priority—closing soon, high value, or neglected—so the most important calls happen first.

### 3. Pipeline Management (Kanban & List)
*The core workspace for managing opportunities.*

*   **Visual Stages:** clearly defined stages (Lead -> Uncommitted -> Committed -> Won/Lost) make it obvious where every deal stands.
*   **Duplicate Prevention:** The system actively checks for duplicate opportunities to keep data clean.
*   **Quick Filters:** Instantly filter by stage, owner, or value to find the needle in the haystack.

### 4. Account Management (360° Customer View)
*Your digital rolodex.*

*   **Activity Logging:** frictionless logging for Calls, Emails, and Meetings.
*   **History Tracking:** See the entire story of a relationship in one scrolling timeline.
*   **Contact Details:** Keep all key decision-makers and their contact info in one place.

### 5. Built-in Enablement (Settings & Guide)
*   **Interactive Guide:** We've built the manual directly into the app. The "Guide" tab explains our sales philosophy, stage definitions, and best practices, so new hires can onboard themselves.
